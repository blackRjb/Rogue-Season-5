# Rogue-Season-5 ATM V1.3

V1.0

#Remodeled interface ( Added builds selection to clean a bit the menu)

#Edited few spell, added to slide bar to few of them to adjust the speed cast_delay.
Smoke grenade and Shadow step got a diffrent scale slide bar to give more space to custom his use in the rotation combo.

#Tweaked the target selector to add a new logic arround totem from umbracrux.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.1

#Added Hybrid Mode to smooth the combat and give it more fluidity (Updated: should work fine with every abilities now, waiting for feedback to)
Hybrid mode = will now automaticaly use any main abilities in fonction of his own adapted rang and not be rang or melee, that made it more fluid and avoid completely the going back and forth all time, using melee abilities will make him go at rang to use that abilities but if your close rang with a long rang abilities it will use it regardlessly if conditions are up obviously.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.2

#Added selector Target by adding a Close Target preference (It will still use preference for elite/champions etc but will prioritise Hardly closest one) that will probably need some adjustement in futur

#Added Dance of knives In preparation of S6 (need to introduce few value onto spell) atm is not valide, just using for interface^^

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.3

#Added on few spells settings Elites/boss only checkbox onto ShadowClone/deathTrap/ShadowStep/PoisonTrap

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.4

#Reworked a bit the hybrid mode when using Barrage, now if target is Elite/boss/champions even if your in range of barrage it will use Shadow step to jump on him to get closer and dps him (that should avoid hitting long range with barrage when few target or in boss type Hord so you dont stay long rang loosing dps 


Todo list : Idk give me idea ^^
