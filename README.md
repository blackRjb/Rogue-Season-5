# Rogue-Season-5
#remodeling of interface 
#Added 2 " predefined Build" most used so once selected you only see the usual spell dedicated to this build 
#if "others build" is selected you will just see every single spell available for rogue ^^
#Added a new Hybrid mode to combat (now you get Melee, distance and hybrid), atm hybrid is coded for barrage since i play it mainly so i didnt added other spell over it so idk if the logic will still work out of barrage as main ability's test and see? :D
#If you have an idea to implement feel free to ask
#I tweaked with the target selector but at the end with hybrid mode target selector looks "ok" atm ( tryed mainly in horde) 
#im new at coding so dont judge this basic work <3
