# Rogue-Season-5
#remodeling of interface 

#Added 2 " predefined Build" most used so once selected you only see the usual spell dedicated to this build 

#if "others build" is selected you will just see every single spell available for rogue ^^

#Added a new Hybrid mode to combat (now you get Melee, distance and hybrid), atm hybrid is coded for barrage since i play it mainly so i didnt added other spell over it so idk if the logic will still work out of barrage as main ability's test and see? :D

#If you have an idea to implement feel free to ask

#I tweaked with the target selector but at the end with hybrid mode target selector looks "ok" atm ( tryed mainly in horde) 

#im new at coding so dont judge this basic work <3

#added slide bar cast_delay on few spell 

#new logic method on target selector for the totem umbracrux

ToDo : rework shadow clone ulti for better logic // add more slide_bar delay for other spell // keep working on Hybrid logic for other spe than barrage
